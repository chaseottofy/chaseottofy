## Highlighted Projects listed in order of most recent

**Check out my portfolio: [ottofy.dev](https://ottofy.dev)**

My most recent polished project, and the best representation of my current skillset is the Next.js Blog.

The google calender clone is the most impressive, but it was also my earliest. It's a good representation of my ability to figure out complex apps from scratch, but it is in no way indicative of my current skillset.
